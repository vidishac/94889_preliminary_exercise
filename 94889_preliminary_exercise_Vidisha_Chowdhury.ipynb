        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this exercise is to provide a quick check on a couple of the technical skills you'll need in Machine Learning for Public Policy Lab (94-889) anbd help us make sure everyone coming in has the necessary pre-requisites including python, data analysis, databases/sql, and machine learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "Feel free to use any references (previous class notes, google, stackoverflow, etc) you would like, but please complete the exercise on your own to ensure the work reflects your experience. **Completing this notebook should take you under 2 hours** -- if you're finding you need to take significantly more time on, you may find it difficult to contribute to the project work in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Background\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook makes use of a sample of the data provided by [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) to the [2014 KDD Cup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data). Public schools in the United States face large disparities in funding, often resulting in teachers and staff members filling these gaps by purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets. DonorsChoose is an online crowdfunding platform that tries to help alleviate this financial burden on teachers by allowing them to seek funding for projects and resources from the community (projects can include classroom basics like books and markers, larger items like lab equipment or musical instruments, specific experiences like field trips or guest speakers). Projects on DonorsChoose expire after 4 months, and if the target funding level isn't reached, the project receives no funding. Since its launch in 2000, the platform has helped fund over 2 million projects at schools across the US, but about 1/3 of the projects that are posted nevertheless fail to meet their goal and go unfunded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Modeling Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purposes of this exercise, we'll imagine that DonorsChoose has hired a digital content expert who will review projects and help teachers improve their postings and increase their chances of reaching their funding threshold. Because this individualized review is a labor-intensive process, the digital content expert has time to review and support only 10% of the projects posted to the platform on a given day. \n",
        "\n",
        "You are a data scientist working with DonorsChoose, and your task is to help this content expert focus their limited resources on projects that most need the help. As such, you want to build a model to identify projects that are least likely to be fully funded before they expire and pass them off to the digital content expert for review.\n"

As a result, more precision (of not being funded) means greater chance that time is spent on projects that actually need review. A higher specificity means a higher fraction of projects that actually needed help were reviewed. Since reviewing projects is labor and time intensive, DonorChoose would not want to spend time on projects which don't need help. Therefore, higher precision may be preferred over specificity even if it comes at a cost of omitting review of some projects that actually need help.\n",

        "DonorsChoose needs to predict projects' risk of not receiving funding, using information available to it at the time a project is posted. This can be done by building a machine learning model based on historical data of project attributes and the ground truth about funding status. In this exercise, we do so by using the datasets 'projects', 'essays', 'resources' and 'outcomes'.  While evaluating various models, we use several metrics such as accuracy and precision. Based on the context of this problem, the chosen model performed best in terms of precision - fraction of the projects predicted at risk which actually did not get funded. The model takes project attributes as input and gives funding probability as output. Based on this, projects at the highest-risk of not being funded can be identified. As expected, the model suggests that the amount of resources a project requests, its student outreach, school location, school's poverty level etc. are important predictors of funding probability. But interestingly, the model also shows that certain finer aspects of the project such as the capital character count of its title, whether it was eligible for a 50% off offer by a corporate partner and if the associated teacher is a Teach for America (TFA) member, are also important in predicting funding. Thus, the project reviewer could recommend reframing project titles, involving faculty associated with establisted non-profits and partnering with corporate companies to attract more funding. It also seems like certain project areas like music, arts, math and science have higher chances of getting funded. Therefore, making sure that project descriptions highlight these areas adequately, can be an effective step.\n",
